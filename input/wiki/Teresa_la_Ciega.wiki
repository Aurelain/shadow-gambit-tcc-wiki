==Abilities==

===Iron Judgement===
Teresa takes out an enemy from a distance by shooting a piece of her soul. She can shoot infinite times, but she needs to retrieve her soul fragment before shooting again.<blockquote>Aim type: straight line with line of sight

Noise: only around the targeted enemy

</blockquote>

===Ashen Judgement===
Teresa shoots a bolt with ash to an enemy, blinding them momentarily. Blinded enemies have a much shorter and slightly narrower view cone. The enemy also stops moving their view cone throughout the duration of the ability.<blockquote>Aim type: straight line with line of sight

Noise: no noise</blockquote>Notes:

* Contrary to the blind abilities in the previous games (Shadow Tactics and Desperados 3), Ashen Judgement has a smaller duration on Commissariuses.
